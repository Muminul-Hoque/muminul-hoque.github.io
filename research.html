    <p>Abstract—The concept of digital identity has gained 
prominence in the digital interconnected world, defined by 
ubiquitous online interactions and transactions. Digital identity 
verification has become essential, facilitating effortless access to 
numerous services. Nonetheless, it poses considerable security 
concerns, 
including inadequate encryption standards, 
susceptibility to identity theft and fraud, low user awareness, 
and dependencies on obsolete verification mechanisms, among 
others. This research provides an innovative security solution 
for digital identity verification using an AES-encrypted smart 
national identification card combined with a two-factor OTP 
authentication mechanism. AES encryption offers formidable 
security by encoding sensitive data, rendering it exceedingly 
challenging for unauthorized individuals to get access. When 
integrated with intelligent NID, it guarantees that only 
authorized users can authenticate their identity. Two factor 
OTP enhances security by necessitating a secondary verification 
method, delivered to a user’s mobile device. This combination 
markedly diminishes the danger of identity theft, unauthorized 
access, and data breaches, thereby safeguarding users’ personal 
and sensitive information in the digital realm. This strategy 
enhances user confidence in digital services while facilitating 
secure and dependable access to vital internet platforms, hence 
fostering digital inclusion in developing nations. </p>

    <p>Abstract—-Traditional cryptographic techniques that form the basis of blockchain
 security are becoming more vulnerable to quantum attacks as a result of the
 development of quantum computing. With an emphasis on Round5 algorithm, this
 paper explores the use of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms to
 strengthen blockchain systems.Round5 operates as an all-purpose secure,
 low-complexity cryptosystem with guaranteed security levels against both classical
 and quantum threats, that will be found sustaining technological evolution in the
 future; therefore, without such an adjustment, all blockchain improvements will be
 at risk. First, this assessment involves an in-depth understanding of how
 blockchain relies on cryptography for secure transactions and privacy. Second, it
 involves the potentially disruptive benefits of quantum computing and its ability to
 hack current cryptographic solutions. Finally, it involves the potential for ROUND5,
 a lattice-based cryptographic solution, to be integrated into a blockchain for better
 safety and operation. This assessing conclusion provides a ROUND5 solution that
 could be used in the architecture of blockchain systems with better safety and no
 drastic operational shortcomings. The quantum-resilient nature inspires
 confidence in this blockchain application for current and future technological use. </p>
